# Rescue
Rescue is a disaster support system that enables communication among the people in the calamity zone even when the cellular network is down by creating a Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct peer to peer mesh network.
Not only does it enable sending and receiving of distress messages and location information but it also covers the situation when the victim is stuck under a roof or under debris and doesn’t have a GPS signal by using other devices in range to triangulate victim’s relative location, possibly location and notify the people close about them. By enabling communication between the survivors and the volunteers and by helping that the people stuck are discovered at the earliest, rescue will make disaster relief operations to function at maximum efficiency and help minimize casualties.
